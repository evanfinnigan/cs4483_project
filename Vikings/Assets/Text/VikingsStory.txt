You are a Viking.
Today is your fifteenth birthday. 
You are the youngest of eight children; you will inherit nothing.
You are desperate to prove your worth.
Build a crew. Raid villages. Destroy monsters. 
Amass gold. Earn glory. Conquer!
Do these things, and you will become a chieftain to your people.
Do these things, and you will become a Viking legend.
